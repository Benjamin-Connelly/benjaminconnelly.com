## Rethinking Texture Tools From the Ground Up

Every year, contractors haul hundreds of pounds of rigid rubber stamps to job sites, press them into wet concrete one at a time, and hope the seam lines aren't too obvious. Architects spec custom textures and wait weeks for a $5,000 mold. Drywall crews patch a wall and pray the spray can matches the existing texture. Potters buy mass-produced wooden rollers that can't flex around the curve of a bowl.

The tools haven't changed in decades. We think they should.

## What We're Building

We're developing **texture transfer tools** — rollers and stamps — manufactured from **3D-printed thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU)** using engineered internal geometries called **gyroids**.

A gyroid is a type of triply periodic minimal surface. In practical terms, it creates an organic, non-repeating pattern that does something no traditional texture tool can do: it responds to pressure. Press harder, get deeper texture. Go lighter, get something subtle. That behavior is built into the geometry itself — no moving parts, no mechanical complexity.

The tools are flexible enough to wrap around a column, light enough to use one-handed, and fully customizable. Need a pattern that doesn't exist in any catalog? We can print it in 24-48 hours.

## The Problem Is Bigger Than You'd Think

### In Construction

Decorative concrete is a **$20+ billion global market** growing at 5.5% annually. The stamping tools sub-market alone moves $200-500 million per year.

But the tools themselves are stuck in the past:

| Pain Point | What Contractors Deal With |
|---|---|
| **Weight** | Stamp sets weigh 200-500 lbs per job. Full days of lifting and placing. |
| **Seam lines** | Every stamp edge leaves a visible line. The #1 complaint on contractor forums. |
| **No customization** | Want a pattern that's not in the catalog? That's $2,000-$5,000 and 4-8 weeks. |
| **Rigidity** | Flat stamps on curved surfaces? Good luck. |

Our rollers eliminate seam lines entirely (continuous rolling vs stamping), weigh 2-5 lbs each, flex around irregular surfaces, and can produce any custom pattern for $399-$799 in a day or two.

### In Drywall Repair

The US drywall repair market is **$8.5 billion** and growing at 14% annually. Ask anyone who manages rental properties what the hardest part of drywall repair is. The answer is always the same: matching the existing wall texture.

Current options are spray cans that rarely match ($8-$15) or hiring a specialist ($200-$500 minimum). A scan-to-roller service — photograph the texture, generate a custom roller, ship it — doesn't exist anywhere. Every piece of that workflow has been independently demonstrated. Nobody has put them together.

### In Craft and Maker Markets

Pottery, ceramics, polymer clay, soap-making — these markets represent **$19+ billion globally**, and texture tools are a growing segment riding the handmade earring boom and renewed interest in ceramics.

Every 3D-printed texture tool on the market today uses rigid PLA plastic. That means they skip across curved surfaces, crack under stress, and can't produce the kind of organic, pressure-responsive textures that TPU with gyroid infill creates naturally.

## How It Compares

| | Traditional Stamps | Existing 3D-Printed Tools | Our Approach |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Material** | Cast rubber / polyurethane | Rigid PLA plastic | Flexible TPU |
| **Weight** | 15-40 lbs per stamp | Light but brittle | 2-5 lbs, durable |
| **Flexibility** | Rigid | Rigid | Fully flexible |
| **Custom patterns** | $2,000-$5,000, weeks | Limited catalog | Any pattern, 24-48 hours |
| **Format** | Flat stamps (seam lines) | Flat stamps / small rollers | Seamless rollers |
| **Curved surfaces** | No | No | Yes |
| **Pressure response** | None | None | Built into geometry |

## Who's Doing This Today?

In construction: **Brickform**, **Proline**, **Walttools**, and **Bomanite** dominate with traditional cast tools sold through established distribution networks. They've been making the same products for decades. None offer 3D-printed tools. None offer custom patterns at accessible prices.

In craft: **Relyef**, **Texturio**, and **CreoClayShop** sell 3D-printed texture tools on Etsy, with the top sellers moving 20,000-30,000+ units. But every single one uses rigid PLA. Nobody is using TPU. Nobody is using gyroid infill as a functional texture surface.

The combination of TPU material + gyroid geometry + roller format is **genuinely novel** and currently **unpatented by anyone** in the space.

## Does It Actually Work?

| What We Tested | What We Found |
|---|---|
| **Durability** | TPU survives 50,000+ flex cycles without degradation |
| **Chemical resistance** | Rated "Good to Excellent" in concrete environments (pH 12+) |
| **Print resolution** | 0.3-0.5mm surface features on standard desktop printers |
| **Release agent compatibility** | Works with water-based formulations (the growing standard) |
| **Production margins** | 55-79% gross margins at target retail prices |

The unit economics are compelling. A small production setup (5 printers, $2,000-$7,500 in equipment) can produce 75-125 medium rollers per month at $13,000-$22,000 in revenue. Capital payback in 1-2 months.

## Intellectual Property

We've reviewed the patent landscape thoroughly. Every relevant prior patent has either expired or covers non-overlapping technology. Freedom to operate is clear.

Multiple aspects of this approach — the geometry, the manufacturing workflow, the material application — represent strong candidates for patent protection.

## The Opportunity

Three markets. Three different scales. One technology platform.

| Market | Size | Growth | Why It's Open |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Decorative concrete** | $20B+ globally | 5.5% CAGR | Zero 3D-printed tools exist |
| **Drywall repair** | $8.5B (US) | 14% CAGR | Zero scan-to-match services exist |
| **Craft / maker** | $19B+ globally | 3-14% CAGR | No flexible 3D-printed tools exist |

Custom concrete patterns alone — at $399-$799 vs the industry's $2,000-$5,000 — represent a value proposition that's hard to ignore. Faster, cheaper, lighter, seamless, and fully custom. Nobody else is offering that combination.
