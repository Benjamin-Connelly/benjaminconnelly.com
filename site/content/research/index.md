## Custom Texture Tools: A New Manufacturing Approach

We're developing a novel method for producing **custom texture transfer tools** using 3D-printed thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) with engineered infill geometries.

The core insight: by using **gyroid infill structures** as the functional texture surface, we can create tools that are flexible, lightweight, and infinitely customizable — properties that no existing product on the market combines.

## Why This Matters

The construction industry relies on stamping and texturing tools that haven't fundamentally changed in decades. Current tools are:

- **Heavy** — traditional stamp sets weigh 200-500 lbs per job
- **Rigid** — can't conform to curved or irregular surfaces
- **Catalog-only** — want a custom pattern? Prepare to spend $2,000-$5,000 and wait weeks
- **Seam-prone** — stamp edges create visible lines that require skilled finishing

Our approach solves all four problems simultaneously.

## The Technology

| Attribute | Traditional Tools | Our Approach |
|---|---|---|
| Material | Cast polyurethane / rubber | 3D-printed TPU (thermoplastic polyurethane) |
| Weight | 15-40 lbs per stamp | 2-5 lbs per roller |
| Flexibility | Rigid or semi-rigid | Fully flexible, conforms to surfaces |
| Customization | Fixed catalog patterns | Any pattern, printed on demand |
| Format | Flat stamps with seams | Seamless rollers |
| Lead time for custom | 4-8 weeks | 24-48 hours |
| Custom pattern cost | $2,000-$5,000 | $399-$799 |

The **gyroid geometry** — a triply periodic minimal surface — produces organic, non-repeating texture patterns with a unique property: pressing harder creates deeper impressions, pressing lighter creates subtle texture. This pressure sensitivity is inherent to the structure and requires no mechanical complexity.

## Market Opportunity

### Decorative Concrete

The global decorative concrete market exceeds **$20 billion** and is growing at 5.5% annually. The stamping tools sub-market alone represents $200-500M in annual spend. Yet no one is manufacturing 3D-printed texture tools for this industry.

Custom patterns represent the strongest value proposition. Architects and contractors currently have no cost-effective way to create bespoke textures. We can deliver custom patterns at **3-10x lower cost** and **10-20x faster** than traditional methods.

### Wall Texture Matching

The US drywall repair market is **$8.5 billion** and growing at 14% annually. The #1 pain point in drywall repair is matching existing wall texture after patching. No scan-to-roller matching service exists anywhere. Every component of the workflow — phone-based texture capture, height map generation, STL conversion, TPU printing — has been independently demonstrated.

### Craft and Maker

The pottery, ceramic, polymer clay, and soap-making markets represent a combined **$19B+ global TAM**. Texture tools are a growing sub-segment driven by the polymer clay earring boom and resurgent interest in handmade ceramics. Our TPU tools offer something no competitor provides: flexibility on curved surfaces with fully custom patterns.

## Competitive Landscape

In the construction space, the major players — Brickform, Proline, Walttools, Bomanite — all sell traditional cast tools through established distribution networks. **None offer 3D-printed tools.** None offer custom patterns at accessible prices.

In the craft space, 3D-printed tools exist (Relyef, Texturio) but all use rigid PLA plastic. **No one uses TPU.** No one uses gyroid infill as a texture-producing surface.

The technology combination is genuinely novel and currently unpatented by anyone in the space.

## Technical Validation

| Parameter | Status |
|---|---|
| TPU durability | 50,000+ flex cycles without degradation |
| Chemical resistance | Rated "Good to Excellent" for concrete environments (pH 12+) |
| Print resolution | 0.3-0.5mm features achievable on standard FDM printers |
| Production economics | 55-79% gross margins at target price points |
| Release agent compatibility | Excellent with water-based formulations (40% market share, growing) |

A 5-printer production setup requires $2,000-$7,500 in capital and can produce 75-125 medium rollers per month, generating $13,000-$22,000 in monthly revenue with a 1-2 month capital payback period.

## IP Position

Freedom to operate is clear — all relevant prior patents have expired or cover non-overlapping technology. Multiple strong patent candidates have been identified covering the novel aspects of this approach.
