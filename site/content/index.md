# Benjamin Connelly

Open source. Monsters. Dark disco. Gripsweat. Fixing things until they're broken.

Outside of tmux, I mass-produce the unnecessary and destabilize the essential. I map cities by graffiti and public art, preserve your abuela's recipes, distribute adhesive propaganda. Often, I'm in a dark room lit by a single red light and a mirrorball ("It's all work, there is no play").

## What I'm Up To

Currently spending time between infrastructure automation, hardware prototyping, and
researching opportunities in construction technology. The kind of rabbit holes where you
end up reading patent filings at 2am and thinking "this is fine."

I also maintain various infrastructure projects, homelab experiments, and the occasional
open-source contribution when the mood strikes.
