# Benjamin Connelly

Engineer. Builder. Tinkerer of things that probably don't need tinkering.

Welcome to my corner of the internet. I build software, break hardware, and occasionally
ship things that work on the first try (lies). I've been writing code since the days when
"deploy" meant burning a CD-R and walking it to the server room.

## What I'm Up To

Right now I'm deep in the weeds on a materials research project involving custom stamp
manufacturing. Think intersection of construction tech, 3D printing, and thermoplastic
polyurethane. The kind of project where you end up reading patent filings at 2am and
thinking "this is fine."

I also maintain various infrastructure projects, homelab experiments, and the occasional
open-source contribution when the mood strikes.
