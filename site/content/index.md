# Benjamin Connelly

Fun. Open source software. Monsters. Dark disco. Fixing things until they're broken.

I mass produce things nobody asked for and break the things people depend on. Somewhere between networking, security, and whatever "DevOps" means this week, I keep the lights on. When I'm not staring at a terminal I'm walking around photographing graffiti, cooking something questionable, feeding my sticker addiction, or at one red light and a mirrorball.

## What I'm Up To

Currently spending time between infrastructure automation, hardware prototyping, and
researching opportunities in construction technology. The kind of rabbit holes where you
end up reading patent filings at 2am and thinking "this is fine."

I also maintain various infrastructure projects, homelab experiments, and the occasional
open-source contribution when the mood strikes.
