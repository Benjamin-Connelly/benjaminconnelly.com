# Benjamin Connelly

Engineer. Builder. Tinkerer of things that probably don't need tinkering.

Welcome to my corner of the internet. I build software, break hardware, and occasionally
ship things that work on the first try (lies). I've been writing code since the days when
"deploy" meant burning a CD-R and walking it to the server room.

## What I'm Up To

Currently spending time between infrastructure automation, hardware prototyping, and
researching opportunities in construction technology. The kind of rabbit holes where you
end up reading patent filings at 2am and thinking "this is fine."

I also maintain various infrastructure projects, homelab experiments, and the occasional
open-source contribution when the mood strikes.
